React Native visionOS allows you to write visionOS with full support for platform SDK. This is a full fork of the main repository with changes needed to support visionOS.

## ðŸŽ‰ Building your first spatial React Native app
Follow the [Getting Started](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-visionos-docs/category/getting-started) guide. If you wish to get started quickly, you can utilize this command: 

```sh
npx @callstack/react-native-visionos@latest init YourApp
``` 


## ðŸ“– Documentation

The full documentation for React Native visionOS can be found on our [website](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-visionos-docs).

The source for the React Native visionOS documentation and website is hosted on a separate repo, @callstack/react-native-visionos-docs.

## Contributing

Prerequisites: 
- Download the latest Xcode (at least 15.2)
- Install the latest version of CMake (at least v3.28.0)

Check out `rn-tester` [README.md](./packages/rn-tester/README.md) to build React Native from the source.

Remember to use `RNTester-visionOS` target

If `RNTester-visionOS` scheme is not showing up, click "New Scheme", which should be pre-populated with `RNTester-visionOS`. Build the app using Xcode.

## Release process

We use a script called `oot-release.js` which automatically releases `visionos` packages and aligns versions of dependencies with React Native core.

Usage:

```sh
node ./scripts/oot-release.js --new-version "<visionos-version>" --react-native-version "<react-native-version>" --one-time-password "<otp>"
```

To test releases and template we use [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/).
